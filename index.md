## Experience

`Aug 2018 - Jul 2020`
__Shape Robotics, Robotics Engineer__, full time

I was hired fulltime as Robotics Engineer after receiving my MSc degree in electrical engineering.
I’m currently working on the Fable Spin module, where my main contributions are:

+ The design and implementation of the positional and speed control algorithms in firmware on the Atmel XMEGA embedded platform.
+ Specification, test and sourcing of suitable DC gear motors for the Fable Spin drive train.
+ Power optimizations for ultra-low power consumption in standby mode.
+ Specialized testing firmware needed during CE and FCC certification.
+ Some mechanical design from prototype to DFM in SolidWorks.


`Aug 2017 - Jul 2018`
__Shape Robotics, Student Developer__, part time

I created:
+ Software tools for internal use in production.
+ The Fable Face mobile app for iOS and Android using Unity.
+ Firmware for the Fable Hub to enable Bluetooth communication with the Fable Face app.


`Aug 2015 - Jul 2017`
__DTU Center for Playware, Student Developer__, part time

I was the first hire at Shape Robotics back in the summer of 2015, when “Fable” was a research project at DTU, lead by David Johan Christensen and Moises Pacheco. During my time as a student developer I helped:
+ Transform the PC software of the research project into a standalone application for release on both Windows and macOS.
+ Produce more than 40 prototypes of the Fable Joint and Fable Hub.
+ Test the Fable system in schools around Zealand.
